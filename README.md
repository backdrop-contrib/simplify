Simplify
========

Simplify allows particular fields to be hidden from the user interface. This
helps to de-clutter forms and present a more user-friendly experience to content
editors.

Different types of fields can be hidden with Simplify. Currently supported field
types include:

- Nodes
- Users
- Comments
- Taxonomy
- Blocks

Fields can be hidden globally or per field type.  
Globally hidden fields are hidden from all forms of that field type (e.g. a
field can be hidden from all node forms (Pages, Articles, etc.)).  
Fields can also be hidden more specifically based on their field type:

- Node fields per content type
- Comment fields per content type
- Taxonomy fields per vocabulary

(e.g. a field can be hidden from the Article content type but still be visible
on the Page content type).
